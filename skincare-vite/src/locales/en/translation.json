I found myself surrounded by a group of people that took care of their conscience by maintaining wellbeing with exercise, healthy food, different kinds of meditation and massages.",
  "our_story_second": "18 years later a different journey took place. My daughter and I moved to live to a far Eastern country. During this journey I learned how people in the East see the world differently and how they value aging in a certain way to preserve health and beauty. Every meal, every drink and cup of tea is medicine for the body and for the æ°” chi.",

  "our_story_fourth": "As I approached my 40th birthday I got concerned about not having grey hair and didn't want to dye it with chemicals that harm my health. So, I searched and found a natural way of reverting this process and on the core helped obtain relaxation and a good night sleep that translated into a healthier life.",
  "our_story_fifth": "As soon as I knew I was coming back home I went into denial mode, as I didn't want to lose the progress of my treatment and all the benefits that came with it. So, I decided to take it with meâ€¦ and share it in Mexico with all people willing to take good care of their health, wellbeing and beauty.",
  "our_story_sixth": "It was a complete challenge to get me trained on the Oriental techniques and translate all the documents into a language I could understand. Practice and practice make the masterâ€¦ so I had to practice. Then just build a business ðŸ˜‰.",
